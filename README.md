# UngatedRNN
This repository contains the papers published in the research area of non-saturating recurrent units. The first paper published in this area, to the best of my knowledge, is the Statistical Recurrent Unit (SRU) [1]. Fourier Recurrent Unit [2] and Non-Saturating Recurrunt Unit (NRU)[3] are two proposed RNNs which improve on the original SRU.
